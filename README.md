## 🔐 How MasterKey Protects Your Data

MasterKey is built from the ground up with **privacy and security** as its core principles.

### ✅ End-to-End Encryption

- All your data (passwords, cards, keys) is **locally encrypted** using a key derived from your **Master Password**.
- Your **Master Password is NEVER stored** — not even on your device.

### 🧠 In-Memory-Only Processing

- The Master Password and decrypted data **exist only in memory** while the app is open.
- Once the app is closed, all sensitive data is wiped from memory.
- What remains on disk is **encrypted**, and without the Master Password, it’s unreadable.

### 📴 100% Offline & Local Storage

- MasterKey **does not connect to the internet** — ever.
- No remote servers, no cloud syncing, no analytics, and no background tracking.
- Your data never leaves your device.

### 🛡️ Unbreakable Protection (Quantum-Level Difficulty)

- The encryption used is strong enough that breaking it would require **quantum computing power**, which is not publicly available yet.
- Even if your device is hacked, no one can access your data without your Master Password.

## 🎯 Why Open Source?

We’ve made MasterKey open source so that:

- 🧑‍💻 Anyone can **audit the code** and verify how it works.
- 🤝 Developers can **contribute** and help improve security, features, and performance.
- 💬 The community can build trust through transparency.

> **Your privacy is our mission — not just a feature.**

## 🧾 No Third-Party Services

Unlike many apps that integrate:
- Google Analytics
- Firebase
- Crashlytics

We’ve intentionally **avoided** all such third-party tools. Your usage data stays with **you**, and your activity is **not tracked**. We prioritize your privacy over developer convenience.
